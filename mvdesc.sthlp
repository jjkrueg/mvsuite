{title:Description}

{p}Produces a table with the number of missing values, total number 
of cases, percent missing and weighted share of missing values for each variable in {varlist}. 
{cmd:wmc} works with both numeric and string variables. This command is based on the the {cmd:mdesc} command but expands it to allow subgroup analysis as well as weighting and some other small features. {p_end}

{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2}{opt ab:breviate(#)} abbreviate variable names to {it:#} of characters; default is {bf:ab(12)}.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{opt wv(string)} specify the variable by which we want to weigh the variables whose missingness we want to analyse; the default is none.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{opt graph} allows the user to automatically create formatted pie charts of the missingness of a variable by weighting variable for all specified variables.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{opt groups(varname)} specify the subgroups by which we want to investigate the missingness of the variables; the default is none.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{opt mvals(values)} specify the values which in addition to the traditional . You want to consider as missing; the default is none.{p_end}
